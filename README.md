## Matrix Fourier Algorithm

<br/>
A few simple MATLAB scripts experimenting with MFA variations for decomposing 1-dimensional FFTs of lengths n = R C (i.e. row column)

The primary motivation for this work is to explore options for optimizating the computation of very large FFTs (larger than say 2^24)
